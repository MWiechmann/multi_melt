# multi_melt
A data wrangling tool to automatize complex series of pandas melt function calls (WIP - not functional yet!)

## What is this for?
I often have to work data-pipelines maintained by others that require files to enter in a specific format. 
The source data often starts with a suboptimal formatting in wide and must be restructured to enter the data warehouse with a specific (somewhat esoteric) format in long form.
This requires a somewhat complex series of pandas.melt function calls. This tool is intended to automatize this process somewhat.

### Example datafile
A typical example source file would look like this:

| Uuid | Date | Weight_tracking | Country | QFOODETAILS_foo1nm | QFOODETAILS_foo1br | QFOODETAILS_foo1cid | QFOODETAILS_foo1url | QFOODETAILS_foo1ch | VQ_foobarfoo1r | VQ_foobarfoo1s1 | VQ_foobarfoo1s2 | VQ_foobarfoo1s3 | VQ_foobarfoo1s4 | VQ_foobarfoo1s5 | VQ_foobarfoo1s6 | VQ_foobarfoo1s7 | VQ_foobarfoo1s8 | VQ_foobarfoo1s9 | VQ_foobarfoo1s10 | VQ_foobarfoo1f1 | VQ_foobarfoo1f2 | VQ_foobarfoo1f3 | VQ_foobarfoo1f4 | VQ_foobarfoo1f5 | VQ_foobarfoo1f6 | VQ_foobarfoo1f7 | VQ_foobarfoo1f8 | VQ_foobarfoo1f9 | VQ_foobarfoo1f10 | VQ_foobarfoo1f11 | VQ_foobarfoo1f12 | VQ_foobarfoo1f13 | VQ_foobarfoo1f14 | VQ_foobarfoo1f15 | VQ_foobarfoo1f16 | VQ_foobarfoo1f17 | VQ_foobarfoo1f18 | VQ_foobarfoo1f19 | VQ_foobarfoo1f20 | QFOODETAILS_foo2nm | QFOODETAILS_foo2br | QFOODETAILS_foo2cid | QFOODETAILS_foo2url | QFOODETAILS_foo2ch | VQ_foobarfoo2r | VQ_foobarfoo2s1 | VQ_foobarfoo2s2 | VQ_foobarfoo2s3 | VQ_foobarfoo2s4 | VQ_foobarfoo2s5 | VQ_foobarfoo2s6 | VQ_foobarfoo2s7 | VQ_foobarfoo2s8 | VQ_foobarfoo2s9 | VQ_foobarfoo2s10 | VQ_foobarfoo2f1 | VQ_foobarfoo2f2 | VQ_foobarfoo2f3 | VQ_foobarfoo2f4 | VQ_foobarfoo2f5 | VQ_foobarfoo2f6 | VQ_foobarfoo2f7 | VQ_foobarfoo2f8 | VQ_foobarfoo2f9 | VQ_foobarfoo2f10 | VQ_foobarfoo2f11 | VQ_foobarfoo2f12 | VQ_foobarfoo2f13 | VQ_foobarfoo2f14 | VQ_foobarfoo2f15 | VQ_foobarfoo2f16 | VQ_foobarfoo2f17 | VQ_foobarfoo2f18 | VQ_foobarfoo2f19 | VQ_foobarfoo2f20 | QFOODETAILS_foo3nm |
